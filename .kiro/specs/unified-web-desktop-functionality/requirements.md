# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on establishing a unified, stable foundation for both web and desktop functionality in the ONE Reference App. The application currently uses Tuono for web functionality and Tauri for desktop packaging, with PGLite as the database layer. The goal is to ensure consistent behavior across both deployment modes (development and production) while maintaining the client-only architecture that has resolved previous hydration issues.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the web application to run consistently in both development and production modes, so that I can confidently deploy and maintain the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is started in development mode THEN the web interface SHALL load without hydration errors
2. WHEN the application is built for production THEN the web interface SHALL maintain the same functionality as development
3. WHEN navigating between routes THEN the application SHALL maintain state consistency across all views
4. WHEN the PGLite database is initialized THEN it SHALL work reliably in both development and production environments

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the desktop application to run consistently in both development and production modes, so that users have a reliable desktop experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the desktop application is launched in development mode THEN it SHALL display the same interface as the web version
2. WHEN the desktop application is built for production THEN it SHALL maintain feature parity with the web version
3. WHEN the desktop application accesses the database THEN it SHALL use the same PGLite instance as the web version
4. WHEN switching between web and desktop modes THEN the user experience SHALL remain consistent

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want all application views to be functional and accessible, so that I can interact with all features of the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the landing page THEN it SHALL display the welcome content and navigation options
2. WHEN navigating to the dashboard THEN it SHALL display system architecture information and navigation
3. WHEN accessing the database page THEN it SHALL display database statistics and allow database interactions
4. WHEN accessing the data page THEN it SHALL display system information and data management features
5. WHEN using theme switching THEN it SHALL work consistently across all views

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the database functionality to work reliably, so that I can store and retrieve data consistently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application initializes THEN PGLite SHALL be properly configured with polyfills
2. WHEN performing database operations THEN they SHALL execute successfully without WASM-related errors
3. WHEN viewing database statistics THEN they SHALL display accurate information about stored data
4. WHEN the database schema is created THEN it SHALL include all necessary tables and sample data
5. IF database initialization fails THEN the application SHALL display appropriate error messages

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the build and development processes to be reliable, so that I can efficiently develop and deploy the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running `pnpm dev` THEN the development server SHALL start without errors
2. WHEN running `pnpm build` THEN the production build SHALL complete successfully
3. WHEN running `pnpm dev:tauri` THEN the desktop development mode SHALL launch properly
4. WHEN running `pnpm build:tauri` THEN the desktop production build SHALL complete successfully
5. WHEN configuration files are updated THEN both web and desktop builds SHALL reflect the changes

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application interface to be responsive and well-designed, so that I have a pleasant user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the application on different screen sizes THEN the interface SHALL adapt appropriately
2. WHEN interacting with UI components THEN they SHALL respond immediately and provide visual feedback
3. WHEN using the navigation system THEN it SHALL provide clear indication of the current page
4. WHEN loading data THEN appropriate loading states SHALL be displayed
5. WHEN errors occur THEN user-friendly error messages SHALL be shown
